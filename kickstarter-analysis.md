# kickstarter-analysis

## Project Overview
Assess and analyze kickstarter campaigns and the various levels of success through many parent and sub categories of data. Generate insights into the correlations between certain kickstarter types, their campaign goals, and the resulting outcomes.

### Anaylsis and Challenges
Analysis Overview: Generally speaking, it appears that failed kickstarters had higher funding goals and less pledged values. This would indicate that the kickstarters that were potentially not market ready were easily perceived by the investing population as unsuccessful ideas or concepts. This correlation applies to all countries in this population. Most, if not all, successful kickstarters across the globe secured adequate funding and more. Investors chose the right opportunities.

Challenges/Difficulties: Ensuring correct visualization with a line chart for the outcome based on goal presented a challenge for me since choosing a stacked line graph would render suboptimal results from what the expectation was meant to be. Cycling through the chart types and viewing each graph helped alleviate any misrepresentations. Also, utilizing the COUNTIFS() function between two separate values while sorting through 2 qualitative data types beyond the initial 2 quantitative, was time consuming, but in applying formatting across the data table, it helped seeing the process of fixing errors that Excel prompts users with.

### Results
#### Observations about "Theater Outcomes on Launch Date"
1. The summer months (May-July) had more successful launch outcomes in total which could indicate that the general public enjoys theater productions more during summertime. Potentially when kids are out of school and people are more likely to take vacation time.
2. In December, it appears as if theater launches have similar success rates. This could pertain to families saving money for holiday travel, presents, etc., or it could be related to the lacking amount of time for extracurricular activities due to the usual time spent with family and loved ones versus seeing a theater production. It might not be the best time to launch any theater production in the Winter months.

#### Observations about "Outcomes Based on Goals"
1. Kickstarters that requested more money in their goals appear to have a lower success rate based on the data. This can be shown by an extremely high failure rate in values greater than $25,000, and even more in the greater than $45,000 range. This could loosely translate to the idea of more logical funding goals equating to more traction from the investing population.

#### Summary of Limitations + Recommendations
1. One thing I noticed is that there weren't any columns to contribute more information about the backers. The backers should not only have a general interest in the kickstarter, but a background in that particular parent category for each kickstarter. If there was a theater production, I would like to know, does this investor have the expertise to gauge out the value in this kickstarter? or is it simply just going on a whim. This could produce a more logical assessment of where the failed outcomes stemmed from, or at least another variable to consider. 
2. Authorship/ownership: Generally speaking, the kickstarter field is bound to have some duplications in this idea. I would like to see if there were any kickstarters connected by the person/company who conceptualized or authored these deliverables. Adding this as another data point would be able to depict any more commonalities between the successful and failed kickstarters alike.
